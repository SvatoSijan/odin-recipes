        <p>Alu pakora is a fried potato dish which is 'hot and <strong>crispy</strong>' on the outside and 'hot and <em>soft</em>' on the inside. It can be enjoyed all year round, but it is <em>DIVINE</em> on a rainy and/or foggy day. Pair it with a <a href="chai.html">chai</a>, and you are good to go.</p>
        
        <p>Now let's make the darn thing.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ingredients</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Potato</li>
                    <li>Onion</li>
                    <li>Gram Flour</li>
                    <li>Cumin Seeds</li>
                    <li>Indian Chat Masala</li>
                    <li>Corn Starch</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Let's Cook</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Wash and peel the potatoes. Then grind them through a mesh. Make sure the mesh is not fine. We want the potatoes a little <strong>THICK</strong>. Cut the onions finely. Mix both of them and add a little corn flour.</li>
                    <li>Make a batter by adding 2 cups of Gram Flour with 2 cups of water. Add the water slowly and mix the flour. We want the batter to be on the runny side. Now add 2 tablespoons of cumin seed and add salt according to your preference.</li>
                    <li>Take a deep dish skillet and put in vegetable or peanut oil. Put it on the gas stove and turn on the gas. We want a high temp. Now make bite-size balls of our potato mixture and coat them with the batter. Then fry them until golden brown, remove them. They will continue cooking until they get a little brown. Then sprinkle them with Indian Chat Masala.</li>
                    <li>Now enjoy your crispy pakodas with a side of ketchup or mint chutney if you can.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
