    <p>Who doesen't like food. After all it is the thing we all work for. The cave man hunted, then the farmer cultivated and now pepole work a 9 to 5 to get a <strong>special token</strong> called <em>"MONEY"</em> to exchange it for food.</p>
    <p> Many people just buy food and many like to make it. Since food is not just a <em><strong>'thing we need to survive'</strong></em>, it now have a cultural, tradictional, emotinal; heck
    even political feelings attach to it.</p>
    <p>It doesen't matter if you aggree with me or not, you should at least aggree that people like to try different food. More so if it is <strong><em>tastyyy</em></em></strong>. So the following are some of my favrioute dishes, hope you like iiit.</p>
